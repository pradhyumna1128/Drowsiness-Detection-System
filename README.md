Developed a real-time drowsiness detection system using OpenCV and computer vision techniques to enhance driver safety. The system tracks facial landmarks to monitor eyes, leveraging Dlib for face and eye detection. Implemented an alert mechanism to notify drivers when drowsiness is detected, reducing the risk of accidents.
